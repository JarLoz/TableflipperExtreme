# TableflipperExtreme
This is TableflipperExtreme, an MTG deck creator for Tabletop Simulator. It will eventually eat Decklists from tappedout and output files that Tabletop simulator accepts.

I do all this because frogtown.me has usability issues.

## Getting started

Install Python3.
Install Imagemagick.
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run `python3 flipper.py --file <decklist> --name <deck name>`
