# TableflipperExtreme
This is TableflipperExtreme, an MTG deck creator for Tabletop Simulator. It will eventually eat Decklists from tappedout and output files that Tabletop simulator accepts.

I do all this because frogtown.me has usability issues.

## Getting started

Install Python3.
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Create folder json/ in project root.
Download and extract [AllSets.json](https://mtgjson.com/json/AllSets.json.zip) and [SetList.json](https://mtgjson.com/json/SetList.json) into the json/ folder.
Run `python3 flipper.py.
